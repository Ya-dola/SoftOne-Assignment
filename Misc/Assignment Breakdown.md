### Day 1: Project Setup and Core Functionality (Prototype)
- Set up your development environment:
  - Install Visual Studio Code and necessary extensions.
  - Install Angular CLI and required dependencies.
  - Install MS SQL Server Express.

- Create a new Angular project:
  - Set up the basic project structure.
  - Create necessary components for the student registration and details.

- Implement core functionality:
  - Create a student registration form with required fields.
  - Set up API calls to connect with the database using C#.NET.
  - Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for student records.

### Day 2: Refine CRUD Operations and API Integration
- Test and debug the CRUD operations:
  - Ensure data is correctly sent to and retrieved from the database.
  - Handle errors and exceptions gracefully.

- Implement API integration for details section:
  - Set up API endpoints for retrieving student details.
  - Integrate API calls into the Angular application for populating the details section.

### Day 3: Implement Pagination and Basic Search
- Implement pagination for the student grid:
  - Display a limited number of records per page.
  - Add navigation controls for page switching.

- Implement basic search functionality:
  - Create a search box that filters records based on any field.
  - Update the grid dynamically as the user types in the search box.

### Day 4: Design and Layout Refinement
- Design the layout:
  - Use CSS or a UI library (such as Angular Material) to style the application.
  - Create a responsive design that works well on different screen sizes.

- Refine user interactions:
  - Implement the click behavior on student rows to show/hide details.
  - Ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.

### Day 5: Finalize Features and Testing
- Implement sorting functionality:
  - Allow users to sort student records based on different fields.

- Test the application:
  - Conduct thorough testing of all features and interactions.
  - Fix any remaining bugs or issues.

- Documentation:
  - Write a brief README that explains how to set up and run the application.
  - Document any important design decisions or implementation details.

Remember, this breakdown is just a suggested plan and can be adjusted based on your own pace and priorities. Since you mentioned focusing on a quick prototype first, the plan focuses on getting the core functionality up and running early on. Once the prototype is functional, you can then proceed with adding the additional features and refining the user interface as you described. Good luck with your assignment, and feel free to ask for assistance when you start working on the implementation!
